# Headers and Formatting 
The level 1 header is the most impressive of all. It sits centered at the top of the page in a large, dark Aniron font. The line following an `h1` header begins with a fancy drop cap letter.

## Header 2
Level 2 headers are red and use a smaller Aniron font.

### Header 3
Level 3 headers are a dark brown Volkorn serif font.

#### Header 4:
Level 4 headers are red and inline with the text that follows. Typically separated with a colon.

##### Header 5
Level 5 switches to the sans serif font Urbanist, and is typically used for table headings (slightly indented) and pop up/down notes. Don't use them for body text like this.

## Emphasis and Lists

Text can be *Italic* / _Italic_ or **Bold** / __Bold__
