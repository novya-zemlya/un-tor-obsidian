## Dwarves of Durin's Folk
The Dwarves are an ancient and proud folk, whose customs and traditions are mostly unknown to outsiders. A dwindling people, they have recently recovered some of their lost great- ness, and a Dwarven King reigns once again under the Lonely Mountain, in Wilderland.

#### CULTURAL BLESSING — REDOUBTABLE 
Dwarves make light of burdens, especially when it comes to wearing armour. 
> You halve the Load rating of any armour you’re wearing (rounding fractions up), including helms (but not shields).

#### NAUGRIM 
Dwarves are shorter than Men, but their work as miners and smiths endows them with powerful arms and shoulders. Yet, they still favour shorter weapons over longer ones. 
> Dwarven adventurers cannot use the following pieces of war gear: great bow, great spear, and great shield.
