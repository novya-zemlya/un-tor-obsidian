## Woodmen of Wilderland
The Woodmen of Wilderland are frontiersmen of the North, sharing their heritage with the Bardings. They live in sparse, isolated villages and homesteads surrounded by wooden stockades, built along the borders of the great forest, or in the val- leys to the west of the river Anduin. Threatened by the shadow of Dol Guldur and what lurks in the depths of Mirkwood, the Woodmen are hunters and trackers of wild animals, battling Orcs and Spiders in self-defence

#### CULTURAL BLESSING â€” WOOD-GOER 
The long fight of the Woodmen against the Hill of Sorcery has led them to exploit every feature of their world to help them in their struggle. They know the woods so well that they can put a name on every shade of green found in a forest, and can trick the eyes of others and use the many obstacles found in the woods to their advantage.
