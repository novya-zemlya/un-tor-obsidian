## Elves of Mirkwood
Also called Wood-elves, the denizens of Northern Mirkwood are the followers of Thranduil the Elvenking. They are a reclusive folk, considered by many to be less wise or ambitious than Elves of nobler lineage, just because they seem content to rejoice in leading hunts and holding feasts, even under the threat of what lurks in the dark of Mirkwood.

#### CULTURAL BLESSING â€” FOLK OF THE DUSK 
While fond of the Sun, the Elves of Mirkwood find themselves at greater ease under moonlight or starlight, or among the shadows of a forest; their senses are keener, their burdens lighter, their movements exceedingly sure and graceful.
