## Rangers of the North
The Rangers of the North are a secret people, severely diminished in number with the passing of a thousand years. They wander in disguise among the ruins of what was once their kingdom of Arnor, tirelessly patrolling its many paths and roads. While the years have lengthened, the task of the Rangers has always been the same: to keep the folk of Eriador free from care and fear. They labour secretly, keeping to them- selves, and rarely giving their names to the travellers they save or to the folk whose farms they guard at night, when evil things come out from dark places

####  CULTURAL BLESSING — KINGS OF MEN 
Some say that the lordship of the folk of Arnor is a thing of the past. Yet, the Rangers of the North have inherited the sinews of those Men who wrested the Ring from the burning hand of Sauron.

#### ALLEGIANCE OF THE DÚNEDAIN 
The Rangers are devoted to fighting Sauron and his min- ions by an ancient tradition of war and strife. This obligation makes it harder for them to put their spirit at ease even when enjoying a respite from adventuring.
