## Hobbits of the Shire
Hobbits are a small and merry folk, possessing a love for timehonoured traditions and respectable ways, and a strong dislike for anything out of the ordinary. If Hobbits had their way, the days would go by in an unchanging world, as they have since anyone can remember. At least, in their land, the Shire. But since the return of Mr Bilbo Baggins from his adventure with a group of Dwarves and a travelling Wizard, something has changed.
