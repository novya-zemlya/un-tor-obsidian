## Elves of Lindon
The Fair Folk of Eriador have dwelt in the Westlands since before the drowning of Beleriand. They are all members of the Firstborn, displaying a wisdom beyond the reach of Men. They rarely leave their sanctuaries in the Grey Havens, for these are their fading years.

#### CULTURAL BLESSING â€” ELVEN- SKILL 
By virtue of their birthright, Elves are capable of reaching levels of finesse unattainable by mortals. 
> If you are not Miserable, you can spend 1 point of Hope to achieve a Magical success on a roll when using a Skill in which you possess at least one rank.

#### THE LONG DEFEAT 
The Elves find it hard to forget the taint of the Shadow once it has left its mark on their spirit. 
> When it is time to remove accumulated Shadow during the Fellowship Phase, you can only remove a maximum of 1 point (see Spiritual Recovery, [[TOR_Core_Rules.pdf#page=123|page 119]]).
