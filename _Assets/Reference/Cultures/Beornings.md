## Beornings
When Beorn broke his isolation after the Battle of Five Armies, many Men chose him as their chieftain — mountain-hunters and fighters without allegiance, warriors who lost their families or who forsook their clans due to their violent tempers, and needful souls drawn to his protective nature.

#### CULTURAL BLESSING — FURIOUS 
Beornings are tough to kill and fight like cornered animals: when they see their own blood they are filled with a red wrath.
