# Adversary Options

### Break shield
The attack strikes repeatedly at the shield fo the targeted Player-hero, smashing it to pieces. The target loses their shield's bonus to Parry (a shield that cannot be smashed is not affected).

### Heavy blow
The attack inflicts an additional loss of Endurance equal to the Attribute Level fo the attacker.

### Pierce
The attacker scores a well-aimed strike, modifying the Feat die result of the attack roll by +2.

### Seize
The attacker holds onto the target-- the victim can only fight in a Forward stance making Brawling attacks. Seized heroes may free themselves spending a 6 from a successful attack roll.-l0
