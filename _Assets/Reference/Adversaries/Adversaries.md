This file can contain your own adversaries. If you enter them in YAML format then the stat block plugin will render them nicely.

You can also export all of the adversaries from the TOR core rules using the bheusemann's JSON exporter and the python-based YAML converter [listed here](https://github.com/bhuesemann/roll20-tor2e-adversary-json-export/issues/1)
