### Degree of Success _(Rules, p. 10)_ 

- `(---)` No success icons: The action was successful, but didn't achieve anything beyond the bare minimum (a _success_).
- `1 success`: _Great success_ - the Player-hero's accomplishment was out of the ordinary.
- `2 successes`: _Extraordinary success_ - The accomplishment was exceptional and memorable.

### Special Success Table _(Rules, p. 19)_ 

| Spend 1 Success to...      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cancel a failure           | If a roll involves multiple players, you help another Player-hero who failed; the failed roll is considered a success.                                                                                |
| Score 1 additional success | If an action requires multiple successes to be achieved, you score 1 additional success.                                                                                                              |
| Gain insight               | You gain additional information, not necessarily related to the taks at hand.                                                                                                                         |
| Go quietly                 | You achieve your goal noiselessly or without otherwise attracting information.                                                                                                                        |
| Make haste                 | You complete the attempted task in a shorter time (about half the expected time).                                                                                                                     |
| Widen influence            | YOu can influence more than the specific number of subjects originally targeted by the action. As a general rule, each Success icon spent corresponds to one additional subject or group of subjects. |

### Die Roll modifiers _(Rules, p. 10)_ 

#### Favoured rolls 

- Roll two Feat dice instead of one, keeping the best result among the two.

#### Ill-favoured rolls 

- Roll two Feat dice instead of one, keeping the worst result among the two.

#### Bonus success dice 

- When it says _gain (1d)_, add 1 Success die to those you are entitled to roll.

##### Hope Bonus 

- Spend 1 (max) Hope point to gain (1d).

##### Inspiration 

- Under certain circumstances, you may become temporarily _Inspired_. Spend 1 Hope point to gain (2d) instead of (1d).

### Die Roll Results _(Rules, p. 11)_ 

#### Penalty success dice 

- When it says _lose (1d)_, roll 1 fewer Success die.

|Feat Die|Result|
|---|---|
|1-10|Read number normally.|
|11|_Eye of Sauron_: Count as a zero.|
|12|_Gandalf_: Success, regardless of TN.|

|Success Die|Result|Special|
|---|---|---|
|1-3|Read number normally|If _Weary_, counts as a 0.|
|4-5|Read number normally.||
|6|Read number normally.|On a successful roll, awards an extra degree of success.|

### Conditions (_Rules, p. 11, 22_) 

#### Miserable 

When the number of Shadow points are equal to or above a Player-hero's current Hope score, they become _Miserable_. Miserable Player-heroes automatically fail if they roll an 11 on the Feat die (Eye of Sauron).

#### Weary 

When Player-heroes' _Endurance_ drops to a level equal to or lower than their Load score, they become _Weary_.

When a Weary hero is making a roll, all the Success dice that come up showing a result in an outlined number (1,2, or 3) are considered to have given a result of zero instead.

#### Wounded 

Serious injuries (caused when a Player-hero fails a _Protection_ test) can cause a Player-hero to be _Wounded_. Wounded heroes who remain active risk being knocked out of combat and recover lost Endurance points more slowly.

### Distinctive Features _(Rules, p. 15)_ 

Players can use their Distinctive Features to improve their chances to succeed at a roll using a Skill. When this happens, the Player-hero is considered to be _Inspired_.

### Resting _(Rules, p. 18)_ 

- **Short rest:** With a short rest, adventurers recover a number of lost Endurance points equal to their _Strength_ (Wounded heroes do not recover any points at all).
- **Prolonged rest:** Player-heroes taking a prolonged rest recover all lost Endurance points (_Wounded_ heroes recover a number of points equal to their _Strength_).

### Useful Items _(Rules, p. 19)_ 

If a Player-hero is making a roll outside of combat using a Skill associated with a useful item, and the Loremaster deems that this should grant the hero an advantage, the Player-hero gains (1d). Only one item can benefit the same die roll.

## Adventuring Phases 

### Combat Phase _(Rules, p. 94)_ 

1. Opening Volleys
2. Close Quarters Rounds

#### Opening Volleys 

Loremaster chooses how many opening volleys are allowed, based on the circumstances. Usually, all combatants are entitled to at least one volley using a bow or a thrown werapon (a spear or a short spear). If the two sides have a greater distance between them, the Loremaster might allow two or more volleys.

#### Close Quarters Rounds 

1. **Stance**: Each player chooses a stance to be in.
2. **Engagement:** Combatants in Close Combat are paired with one or more opponents.
3. **Action Resolution:** Combatants declare what they want to to do.

##### Stances 

|Stance|Benefit|Drawback|Combat Task|Effect|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Forward (Close Combat)|Attack +1(d)|Attacks vs. you +1(d)|Intimidate Foe (AWE)|Opponents with Might 1 are Weary on next attack roll, +1 enemy/success|
|Open (Close Combat)|none|none|Rally Comrades (ENHEARTEN)|Company in Forward +1(d), other stances/success|
|Defensive (Close Combat)|Attacks vs. you -1(d)|Attacks -1(d)|Protect Companion (BATTLE)|Attacks vs. protected are -1(d), -1/success|
|Rearward (Ranged Combat)|ranged attacks vs. you|Ranged attacks only|Prepare Shot (SCAN)|+1(d) on your next ranged attack, +1/success|

#### Advantages _(Rules, p. 102)_ 

|Attacker enjoys a...|Modifier|Examples|Ranged attack circumstances|
|---|---|---|---|
|Moderate advantage|Gain (1d)|Attacking from the high ground, exploiting a favourable terrain feature.|Target is moving slowly, is big, or availabe cover is scarce.|
|Greater advantage|Gain (2d)|The defender is hindered, is blinded by heavy snow, knee-deep in mud or swift-running water, etc.|Target is stationary, is very big (a dragon), or without available cover.|

#### Complications _(Rules, p. 102)_ 

|Attacker is...|Modifier|Examples|Ranged attack circumstances|
|---|---|---|---|
|Moderately hindered|Lose (1d)|Standing on difficult terrain, suffering unfavourable weather conditions, or in cramped quarters.|Target is at medium range, or is under good cover (trees from a sparse wood).|
|Severely hindered|Lose (2d)|Almost blinded by heavy snow, knee-deep in mud or swift-running water, or in darkness.|Target is at long range, is very small (a bird), or protected by darkness or ample cover (trees in a dense wood).|

#### Adversary Special Damage Options _(Rules, p. 144)_ 

What enemies can do with their extra successes (6 on a Success die):

- **Break shield**: The attack strikes repeatedly at the shield fo the targeted Player-hero, smashing it to pieces. The target loses their shield's bonus to Parry (a shield that cannot be smashed is not affected).
- **Heavy blow:** The attack inflicts an additional loss of Endurance equal to the Attribute Level fo the attacker.
- **Pierce:** The attacker scores a well-aimed strike, modifying the Feat die result of the attack roll by +2.
- **Seize:** The attacker holds onto the target-- the victim can only fight in a Forward stance making Brawling attacks. Seized heroes may free themselves spending a 6 from a successful attack roll.-l0

#### Endurance _(Rules, p. 69)_ 

Player-heroes whose Endurance is reduced to zero drop unconscious, and wake up after one hour with 1 Endurance point (unless they are also _Wounded_-- see Wounds, p. 101).

- **Fatigue:** When gained, Fatigue points remporarily raise a travelling Player-hero's total Load, effectively making it easier to become Weary.
- **Weary:** Heroes become Weary if their Current Endurance score becomes equal to or lower than their total Load. When this appens, the Weary box on their character sheet is ticked.

#### First Aid _(Rules, p. 101)_ 

A successful _Healing_ roll reduces the severity of an injury by 1 day, plus 1 day for each icon scored (to a minimum of 1 day).

**Reviving Heroes:** Dying heroes must receive a successful _Healing_ roll within approximately 1 hour or they will die.

#### Wound Severity _(Rules, p. 101)_ 

|Feat Die Roll|Description|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|11, Eye of Sauron|Grievous injury|You are knocked unconscious with zero Endurance and are now Dying (as if Wounded twice).|
|1-10|Severe injury|The value indicates how long it will take for the injury to mend, expressed in days (write the result in the Injury box on the character sheet).|
|12, Gandalf|Moderate injury|The blow received was violent enough to expose you to the risk of worse consequences if injured again, but no real lasting damage was inflicted. At the end of the combat, you will recover fully in a matter of hours (remove the Wounded box check).|

### Council Phase 

### Journey Phase _(Rules, p. 109)_ 

1. **Set Journey Path**: Players choose the route of travel.
2. **Make marching rolls**: Different Company members make tests to see how well they do their chosen roles
3. **Ending the Journey:** Upon reaching the destination of the journey, players can recover travel fatigue.
