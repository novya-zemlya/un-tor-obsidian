# Inventory

#### Useful Item
If a Player-hero is making a roll outside of combat using a Skill associated with a useful item, and the Loremaster deems that this should grant the hero an advantage, the Player-hero gains (1d). Only one item can benefit the same die roll.

#### Vigor
While travelling, all Player-heroes gain a number of points of Travel Fatigue, as a result of journey events. At the end of a journey, Player-heroes travelling with a mount reduce their Fatigue total by their beast’s Vigour rating (see the rules for journeys, on [[TOR_Core_Rules.pdf#page=112|page 108]]). Additionally, ponies and horses can be laden with those riches the Player-heroes discover in the course of their adventuring (see Treasure, on [[TOR_Core_Rules.pdf#page=162|page 158]]). Each pack animal can carry Treasure up to 10 points of Load.

## Weapons & Combat

### Combat :TrTengwar: Spends

When you successfully strike an enemy in combat, and you roll one or more sixes, every tengwar (:TrTengwar:) can be spent on your choice from the following options, where applicable:

| **Spend a :TrTengwar:** | **Requirements and Result** |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Heavy Blow**  | *Any weapon* <br> Do additional damage equal to your Strength attribute. <br> **1H:** Strength, **2H:** Strength+1 |
| **Fend Off**    | *Any close combat weapon* <br> Add to your parry this round. <br> **Spears +3, Swords +2, Other +1** |
| **Pierce**      | *Bows, Spears, and Swords* <br> Add to your Feat Roll, to get a Piercing Blow and force a Protection Test. <br> **Swords +1, Bows +2, Spears +3** |
| **Shield Thrust** | *If using a shield* <br> Push back an enemy if your Strength is greater than their Attribute. <br> **-1d to actions this round** |

### SPECIAL DAMAGE 
They say that the combatant that strikes the first blow, if they strike it hard enough, may need to strike no more. If a successful attack roll produces one or more Suc- cess icons ( ), they can be used to trigger one or more special results, based on the war gear of the attacker. Multiple Success icons can be used to trigger different results, or the same one multiple times. 
#### HEAVY BLOW — ANY WEAPON:
You have hit your opponent with great force and precision — Spend 1 Success icon to inflict to your adversary an additional loss of Endurance equal to your STRENGTH rating. Raise the loss of Endurance by an additional +1 if you are using a 2-handed weapon. 
#### FEND OFF — ANY CLOSE COMBAT WEAPON: 
You exploit your successful attack to place yourself in an advantageous position — Spend 1 Success icon to modify your Parry rating for the round by +1 using Axes and all Brawling weapons, +2 using Swords, and by +3 using Spears. 
#### PIERCE — BOWS, SPEARS AND SWORDS: 
You have hit a less- protected part of the adversary’s body — Spend 1 Success icon to modify the Feat die numerical result of your attack by **+1 if using Swords**, **+2 if using Bows**, and by **+3 if using Spears**, up to a maximum of 10 — thus possibly triggering a Piercing Blow ( and results are unaffected). 
#### SHIELD THRUST — SHIELD: 
You bash your opponents with your shield, pushing them back — If your STRENGTH is greater than the target’s Attribute Level, spend 1 Success icon to push back your target. The adversary is inflicted a penalty, losing (1d) for the length of the round (in the rare case this special damage is triggered multiple times, it must be employed to push back different opponents). 

### PIERCING BLOWS 
 - An attack roll produces a Piercing Blow on a 10 or result on the Feat Die (9+ for *Keen* weapons). 
 - Protection Roll: Roll a Feat Die, plus a number of Success Dice equal to the PROTECTION (:RaVest:) value of the armour worn. The Target Number for the roll is equal to the Injury (:RaDrippingSword:) rating of the weapon used by the attacker. If the roll fails, then the target of the attack has received a life-threatening blow — a Wound (see page 101).

# Company

### Fellowship
 - During the Adventuring Phase, Player-heroes can spend points of Fellowship to recover points of Hope when resting (see page 71)
 - Fellowship points are fully refreshed at the end of each gaming session.

#### Fellowship Focus
- Player-heroes providing support (spend 1 hope) to their Fellowship Focus make them gain (2d) instead of (1d). 
- Player-heroes gain 1 Shadow point whenever their Fellowship Focus is Wounded, suffers a bout of mad- ness, or is otherwise seriously harmed (this Shadow gain cannot be prevented with a Shadow Test — see page 137).

#### Skill Success Table
