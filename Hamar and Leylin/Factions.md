# Factions in Eriador

## The Spider
### Background
The Spider is a petty criminal turned agent of evil, originally hired by Saruman to locate Dwarven relics and places of ancient power. His greed and ambition made him a useful pawn. However, his path was twisted by Sauron, whose influence has driven him further into corruption. Now fully serving the Enemy, the Spider seeks to gather relics to unlock dark powers, though he often lacks the understanding of what he is truly dealing with.

### Activities
- **Relic Hunting:** The Spider scours ancient Dwarven sites, looking for artifacts of power. He uses stolen maps and fragmented lore to guide his search.
- **Rituals:** Attempting to use relics in rituals to awaken or harness malevolent forces, though his efforts often result in unintended consequences.
- **Recruitment:** Gathers thugs and desperate men to serve his cause, creating a loosely organized band of raiders and spies scattered across Eriador.
- **Corruption:** As he falls deeper into his Shadow Path, the Spider has become thieving and overconfident, often underestimating his opponents but relying on increasingly cruel and cunning tactics. His mind and body have been warped by an evil spirit that has latched on to his soul.

## The Rangers
### Background
The Rangers of the North are the remnants of the Dúnedain, descended from the ancient kingdom of Arnor. Led by figures like Gilraen, they serve as silent protectors of Eriador, guarding its people from threats they often remain unaware of. Despite their valor, they are few in number and spread thin across a vast region.

### Activities
- **Patrolling Eriador:** Protecting travelers, villages, and ruins from brigands, beasts, and darker forces.
- **Investigations:** Tracking signs of growing evil, such as strange gatherings or relics of power being disturbed.
- **Guardianship:** Preserving ancient places and knowledge, ensuring they do not fall into the hands of those who would misuse them.
- **Alliances:** While secretive, the Rangers ally with those they trust, such as hobbits, elves, or occasional adventurers, to maintain a watchful presence in dangerous times.

## Saruman
### Background
Saruman, the White Wizard and head of the White Council, is outwardly known as a wise and benevolent leader among the Free Peoples. However, in secret, he has begun laying the groundwork for his own rise to power. Believing himself capable of contesting Sauron, Saruman delves into ancient lore and manipulates events to his advantage, even at the cost of serving evil ends.

### Activities
- **Artifact Collection:** Employing thugs and agents like the Spider to recover ancient relics, especially those tied to Dwarven craftsmanship or dark powers.
- **Espionage:** Sending spies into regions like Eriador to gather information and establish influence.
- **Building Power:** Secretly amassing knowledge and resources for his future plans, including creating an army in Isengard.
- **Manipulation:** Using his reputation to mask his true intentions, Saruman influences individuals and factions to act on his behalf, often without their awareness.

## Sauron
### Background
Sauron, the Dark Lord, remains hidden in Mordor, rebuilding his strength after his defeat during the Last Alliance. Though his power is not yet fully unleashed, his influence is growing. Shadows stretch across Middle-earth, subtly manipulating events and drawing allies to his cause.

### Activities
- **Corrupting Agents:** Twisting individuals like the Spider from Saruman’s service into his own, using their greed and fear to deepen their fall into Shadow.
- **Dark Whispers:** The Enemy’s influence stirs unrest and fear, awakening malevolent spirits and corrupting places of ancient power.
- **Spreading Evil:** Orcs, wargs, and other servants begin to move in small numbers through Eriador, testing the vigilance of its defenders.
- **Sowing Discord:** Using his growing power to weaken alliances among the Free Peoples, ensuring that resistance to his eventual return will be fractured and unprepared.

## The Elves
### Background
The Elves of Middle-earth, particularly the Noldor of Rivendell, are ancient and wise guardians of lore, tasked with preserving knowledge and protecting the world from the shadow’s return. Though their power wanes in the Third Age, they remain vigilant in their watch over places of significance and artifacts of power. [[Elenion]], a Noldor Elf, embodies this role, using his deep knowledge to counter the spread of evil in Eriador.

### Activities
- **Preservation of Lore:** Collecting and safeguarding ancient knowledge and artifacts, ensuring they do not fall into the wrong hands.
- **Guardianship of Sacred Places:** Watching over ruins, waystations, and sites of power, keeping them from being desecrated or misused.
- **Alliances with the Free Peoples:** Supporting the Rangers and occasional adventurers when their goals align with the protection of Middle-earth.
- **Subtle Intervention:** Acting with precision, often choosing to guide events rather than take direct action, in keeping with their fading presence in the world.

## The Dwarves
### Background
The Dwarves of Middle-earth are a proud and enduring people, known for their mastery of craftsmanship and resilience against adversity. At this time, Balin is leading an expedition to reclaim Moria, though news of his efforts remains scarce and shrouded in mystery. Dwarves in the Blue Mountains, like Hamar, live in relative isolation and are largely unaware of the events unfolding in the East.

### Activities
- **Balin’s Expedition:** Balin’s journey to Moria has rekindled hope among some dwarves, though it is a perilous venture fraught with danger from ancient evils lurking in the depths.
- **Crafting and Trade:** The Blue Mountains and other dwarven settlements continue their renowned work as craftsmen, producing exceptional tools, weapons, and jewelry for trade.
- **Exploration:** Some dwarves, like Hamar, are driven by a desire to uncover their people’s lost history, tracing ancient routes and way stations that connected their kingdoms of old.
- **Guardians of Heritage:** The dwarves are fiercely protective of their relics and history, viewing intrusions into their ruins and mines as deeply offensive. This has made the Spider’s activities a direct threat to their legacy.

## The Hollow Men
### Background
The Hollow Men are a mysterious group of shadowy figures operating in the darker corners of Eriador, including the Trollshaws. They are neither wholly brigands nor fully aligned with the Enemy, but something about their presence suggests a deeper and more insidious purpose. Their name comes from their gaunt appearance and the eerie silence with which they operate, leading many to believe they are cursed or otherwise touched by dark forces.

Rumors about the Hollow Men suggest they were once a band of desperate outlaws who stumbled upon something ancient and corrupt within the ruins of the Trollshaws. Whatever they found has bound them to this region and warped their purpose, though their true motivations remain unclear.

### Activities
- **Guardians of the Ruins:** The Hollow Men fiercely defend certain areas of the Trollshaws, particularly ancient ruins. Whether this is due to greed, fear, or a darker compulsion is unknown.
- **Ambushes and Raids:** They ambush travelers and caravans, taking goods and supplies but leaving behind cryptic warnings etched into stone or wood.
- **Obsession with Relics:** They seem particularly drawn to relics and artifacts of power, especially those tied to the ancient kingdoms of Arnor and Angmar. It’s unclear whether they are collecting these for a specific purpose or simply hoarding them.
- **Connection to the Spider:** There are whispers that the Hollow Men have crossed paths with the Spider, though the nature of their relationship—if it exists—is shrouded in mystery.

### Traits
The Hollow Men operate as a neutral faction, capable of both hostility and negotiation depending on circumstances. Their behavior hints at internal divisions: some appear more human and pragmatic, while others exhibit signs of being twisted by malevolent forces. This duality leaves those who encounter them guessing whether they are dealing with desperate survivors or something far worse.

The truth behind the Hollow Men and their connection to the Trollshaws holds the potential to either aid or threaten the party as they uncover the region’s deeper mysteries.
