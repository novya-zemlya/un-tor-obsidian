We reach The Trollshaws, only slightly worn down in a single day. Caladwen is surprised that Hamar found a route that even she was unfamiliar with, increasing her respect for him rather significantly. As the sun rises on their second day, they begin to head along the road, taking care not to go far into the woods.

>The Trollshaws are a rugged, forested landscape of dense thickets and rocky outcroppings, where gnarled trees twist skyward, their branches creating a canopy that filters the sunlight into dim, patchy beams. The air is cool and damp, filled with the scent of moss and wet earth. Scattered ruins of ancient stone structures—crumbled walls, leaning arches, and weathered pillars—hint at a long-forgotten past. Streams wind their way through the terrain, their babbling sounds sometimes drowned out by the eerie silence that hangs in the air. Shadows seem to linger longer here, and the occasional distant rustle keeps travelers on edge, as if unseen eyes are watching from the undergrowth.

Before long, Caladwen hushes the party, and pulls them to the side of the road under the cover of some bushes. Amidst the deep shadows of the path head, is a troll! We are surprised to find one out during the day, and seeing it upon the road is even more unusual. 

> The troll lumbers down the road, its footsteps shaking the ground ever so slightly. It moves with a sense of purpose, but its behavior is strange—uncharacteristically wary, its head swinging left and right, scanning the path and its surroundings as if it fears an ambush. The sight of a troll in daylight is unusual enough, but here, on a road where no troll should wander, it is deeply unsettling.
> As the party watches from the bushes, movement in the shadows near the trees catches their attention. A small group of figures emerges, cloaked and hooded. They stay low, carefully keeping out of sight of the troll, as if stalking it. Their motions are deliberate and quiet, not the clumsy rush of desperate men, but the practiced steps of those who know how to stay unseen. The party can make out four of them, each armed with simple but functional weapons—a short sword here, a bow there.

Leylin passes an awareness check watching the men, intuiting that they seem to be tracking the Troll and making sure that it doesn't head in certain directions.

> The troll pauses on the road, sniffing the air, its beady eyes scanning the trees. One of the cloaked figures tenses, gripping a bowstring but holding their fire. After a long, tense moment, the troll huffs and continues along the road, veering off into the forest.

Once the troll disappear around a bend, we step out of the bushes, surprising the men who linger along the roads. Leylin gives a cheerful "Hullo!" but the men shy back clearly upset to have been caught unaware. (Leylin fails her Courtesy skill roll to ease them). 

>The men stiffen at Leylin’s unexpected greeting, their hands instinctively moving to their weapons. The leader, a gaunt man with sharp features and a hood pulled low over his face, takes a step back, his eyes darting between the party members. “Who are you, and why are you sneaking about?” he demands, his voice taut with suspicion.
>Another man, broader and younger, grips the hilt of his sword but doesn’t draw it. “You’ve no business here,” he mutters, glancing nervously toward the bend in the road where the troll disappeared. “This isn’t a place for wanderers.”
>The leader shoots him a sharp look before turning back to the group. “Speak quickly. If you’ve been following us or that beast, you’d best explain yourselves. There’s trouble enough in these parts without strangers making it worse.”

"Why are there trolls on the roads? This is most unusual!" asks Caladwen.
