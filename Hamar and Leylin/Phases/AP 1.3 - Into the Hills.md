### Pursued by the Spider
The [[The Spider]] and [[The Enforcer|Enforcer]] are pursuing the party. At the end of each scene, roll against Eye Awareness using a feat die. If :TrEye: or <= Eye Awareness score, then we have been found by the spider's web! If the scene was highly successful, roll with advantage, if it was unsuccessful, roll with disadvantage. The scene will typically have up to Eye/2 characters; defeating a character lowers eye accordingly.

### Scene 1: On the Road
As the group presses on under the eerie glow of the moon, they crest a low hill and come upon a small, flickering campfire nestled in a shallow dell just off the path. Around the fire, a trio of **wandering elves** sits in quiet conversation, their melodic voices carrying softly on the breeze. The elves are clad in cloaks of deep green and gray, their fair faces illuminated by the gentle firelight.

The leader, a tall and serene elf with silver hair flowing like starlight, stands as the group approaches, a welcoming but cautious smile on his lips. “Travelers in the night,” he says in a voice like a soft melody. “You are far from the safety of towns. What brings you to these hills under shadow?”

Leylin is utterly astonished to have happened upon a group of the Fair Folk so close to her home. All this time she has dreamed of exploring and meeting new people, but believed this dream was too far beyond her doorstep to ever come true. And now she just stumbles upon some elves!

She eagerly explains (perhaps too much of) their mission. Describing how Bilbo has sent them on a mission to learn more about the map which apparently marks a series of ancient Dwarven waystations from past ages when they had trading routes and mining operations in this region. The elves are amused and impressed by her eagerness and share a bit of knowledge. What do they tell us?

 The elves tell Leylin and Hamar that the map they possess is indeed ancient and likely holds clues to hidden treasures and secrets of the past. They explain that the Dwarven waystations were once crucial hubs for trade and communication between different Dwarven clans, as well as with other races. The elves warn the party to be cautious, as the hills are known to be treacherous and filled with old traps and dangers left behind from those ancient times.

A serene, silver-haired elf named [[Elenion]] leans forward, his voice carrying a melodic quality that seems to harmonize with the night breeze. "Legends do speak of haunting," he begins, his eyes reflecting both memory and mystery. "Weathertop, or Amon Sûl as it was once known, holds remnants of an ancient past. It was here that great watchtowers stood, where men kept vigil over Arnor."

The elves exchange knowing glances before Elenion continues. "In times long past, shadowy figures were said to roam these lands—perhaps echoes of those who fought bravely against darkness or spirits drawn by the power that once surged through this place. Yet fear not; these hills hold stories rather than malice."

Another elf adds softly, "The land remembers its history as we remember our songs. Treat it with respect and you may find its whispers guide you rather than hinder you."

### Scene 2: Exploring the Hills
The next morning we wake to find the elves already gone. While Leylin is disappointed at their sudden disappearance, her excitement outweighs her sadness. We continue up to Weathertop.

>  5. Explore - Hamar persistently leads the pair onwards, climbing a hill to better survey the area. His hike is rewarded with a clearer picture of where we should head (+3)

Emerging from behind a rocky outcrop, a group of dark-clad figures appears. It's clear that these are agents of The Spider, with an aura of menace about them. Their leader, The Enforcer, stands at the forefront—a tall man with an imposing presence and eyes that burn with cruel intent. His voice carries over the wind with a mocking tone.

"Lost in your own riddles, are you?" he sneers. "The Spider has no time for such games. Hand over what you possess and perhaps I'll spare you."

Leylin and Hamar exchange determined glances; they know his word are an outright lie. The've already seen the Spider's cruelty and ruthlessness, and know that the Enforcer will not stop until they have been silenced.

We quickly dispatch the thug. Leylin is hurt by the Enforcer, and Hamar is wounded and nearly knocked out by him. At the last moment, Hamar throws off his buckler and charges The Enforcer with his two handed axe, defeating him once and for all! The duo is shocked and more than a bit horrified at what they've just done, but these men were clearly tainted by evil and would have killed them without a second thought.

The two adventurers take a moment to assess their surroundings. The Enforcer's defeat may have bought them some time, but they know that The Spider's web is wide and that more dangers could lurk nearby. Leylin kneels by the fallen Enforcer, searching for any clues or items that might aid them in their quest to recover the map before it falls into enemy hands. What does she find?

As Leylin carefully searches the fallen Enforcer, she discovers a small, intricately carved wooden box tucked inside his cloak. The box is sealed with a delicate mechanism, resembling the twisting branches of an ancient tree. Upon closer inspection, she notices faint Elvish runes etched along its edges, hinting at its mysterious origin.

![[SpiderWeb.png|profile+medium right lp]]Inside the Enforcer's pocket, Leylin also finds a crumpled piece of parchment bearing The Spider's symbol—a sinister web encircling a lidless eye. Scrawled hastily in the margins are fragmented instructions that mention an impending rendezvous at a place called "The Stone Circle" within the hills.

Leylin shares her findings with Hamar, and together they deduce that this meeting might be their next lead in preventing The Spider from reclaiming the map. The discovery of the box and the parchment suggests that their adversary is closer than they would like, but it also presents them with an opportunity to intercept and outmaneuver him before it's too late.

*That's all for now!*
