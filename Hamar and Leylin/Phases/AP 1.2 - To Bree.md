### Pursued by the Spider
The [[The Spider]] and [[The Enforcer|Enforcer]] are pursuing the party. At the end of each scene, roll against Eye Awareness using a feat die. If :TrEye: or <= Eye Awareness score, then we have been found! If the scene was highly successful, roll with advantage, if it was unsuccessful, roll with disadvantage.

### Scene 1: On the Road
We travel towards Bree. We hit two delays that leave Leylin pretty worn out!

1. **A Sudden Spring Storm:** Midway through their journey, a heavy downpour turns the dirt road into a muddy quagmire, forcing the group to slow their pace considerably. The storm drenches Leylin, leaving her chilled and weary from the effort of trudging through the muck.
2. **A Blocked Path:** Later, they encounter a group of travelers with an overturned cart, its wheel hopelessly stuck in a rut. The group spends valuable time helping clear the road, with Leylin lending her small hands to retrieve scattered goods. The extra exertion leaves her particularly fatigued by the day’s end.

### Scene 2: Arrival at Bree
Concerned about being noticed by the Spider's eyes, we decide to enter town through the less used gate towards the north end of town. Leylin leads the way, stealthily guiding Hamar's not so subtle steps. We manage to make it into the town quietly. Hamar has been to Bree before, but Leylin has never been. Unfortunately, her overt enthusiasm and curiosity end up making her stand out even among hobbits. Perhaps we were not as unnoticed as we thought.

We end up following our leads into the Prancing Pony. We have not been spotted yet.

### Scene 3: The Pony
We make our way into Bree and reach the Prancing Pony Inn. We enter separately to reduce suspicions. We separately try to talk with the inn keeper, Buterbur, to see if he can give us a clue about who can help us with the map.

We learn:
1. **A Scholar in Town:** Butterbur mentions an old wanderer named **Oswald Breeker**, a reclusive scholar known for his knowledge of ancient maps and relics. Breeker often stays in Bree for short periods and is said to frequent the Prancing Pony’s quieter corners in the evenings. He has a reputation for being cryptic but helpful if approached with care.
3. **A Warning from Hamar's Lore:** By showing Ori’s journal and discussing Dwarven history, Hamar uncovers a chilling detail: one of the locations on the map corresponds to an old Dwarven ruin known to harbor cursed relics. This revelation suggests the Spider may be seeking something far more dangerous than simple treasure.

### Scene 4: Oswald Breeker
That evening, we notice Breeker arrive and take a quiet table towards the back of the Inn. We approach him. Leylin stumbles heavily on the introduction, likely raising attention in the room.

Breeker acknowledged the possibility of a Dwarven map marking ancient waystations and recounted seeing similar markings near the **Weather Hills** and possibly near the **Hills of Evendim**. He warned that such places, while tied to Dwarven heritage, are often dangerous and not as abandoned as they seem. Breeker emphasized the value of vigilance and the burdensome nature of reclaiming ancient knowledge or treasures, cautioning against underestimating the challenges ahead. While he hadn’t seen the map itself, his insights provided potential leads for the group to investigate further.

We spend the next two nights at the Inn to recover.

### Scene 5: Investigation Interrupted

The Prancing Pony is bustling with its usual mix of locals and travelers, the warm glow of lanterns illuminating the lively common room. The air is thick with the smell of ale, roasted meat, and pipe smoke, and the hum of conversation fills the space. At a table near the corner, Hamar and Leylin are quietly discussing their plans when a loud crash interrupts the evening's rhythm.

A heavy-set man in a stained tunic stumbles backward into another patron, sloshing his mug of ale everywhere. “Watch yourself!” he bellows, his face flushed red with drink—or perhaps feigned anger. Another man, wiry and sharp-eyed, steps into the fray, glaring at the first. "You've got a big mouth for a clumsy oaf!" he snarls, his tone a little too pointed to be casual.

Before anyone can intervene, a shove turns into a thrown punch, and chaos erupts in the common room. The brawl begins with shouts and the scrape of overturned chairs, quickly spreading to include innocent patrons caught in the commotion. It’s clear that the rowdy “drunks” are targeting your group, their movements too coordinated to be mere happenstance. Butterbur, the innkeeper, shouts for calm, but his voice is drowned out by the clamor of the fight.

### Scene 6: An Old Friend
It doesn't seem safe here, but we need a spot to rest. We head out into town, heading towards the poorer area where hobbits live. While the people there live simple lives, they aren't brutes. Luckily, Leylin runs into someone she knows!

![[HobbitMarigold.png|profile+medium right lp]] As the group weaves through the quiet back alleys, Leylin suddenly stops short, her sharp eyes widening in surprise. Standing near a small produce stall in the hobbit quarter is a familiar figure: [[Marigold Heathertoes]], a cheerful and resourceful hobbit from the Shire. Marigold is a distant cousin of Leylin's on her mother's side, known for her knack for gardening and her adventurous streak, which occasionally leads her to travel beyond the Shire to trade seeds and herbs. Leylin's parents rarely allowed the two to interact.

Dressed in a simple brown cloak with a sprig of lavender tucked into her lapel, Marigold’s face lights up as she spots Leylin. “Well, bless my buttons!” she exclaims, stepping forward. “Leylin Took! What in the name of second breakfast are _you_ doing in Bree?”

Marigold takes us back to an aunt's house, where we patch ourselves up and rest for the night for a few more days, hidden amongst the short folks.
