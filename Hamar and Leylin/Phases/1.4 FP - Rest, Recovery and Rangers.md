After the battle with The Spider, [[Elenion]] explains that he must take news of what has happened to his kin in Rivendell. Leylin eagerly asks to come along, but he flatly refuses. However, he suggests that we take the strange things we have found to the Ranger encampment to alert them of the situation. While Leylin is a bit skeptical of the "tall drifters" based on the rumors she's heard in the Shire, Hamar says that he has heard they are noble people so she agrees to the plan. One of the elves leads the duo east along the road, and then south by the river until they suddenly find themselves surrounded by cloaked men and women. While the rangers aren't known for their hospitality, Elenion's endorsement (and perhaps the unusualness of the pair) is sufficient for the rangers to invite them to stay for a day. Leylin's infectious cheer (and good supply of fine pipe weed) soon leads to this being extended to a week.

### Treasure Hoard
Examining the items we recovered from the stone circle we find a Greater Hoard.
- 10 treasure per hero, no magical treasures

### Undertaking 1: Strengthen Fellowship
*+1 FP until next phase*
Hamar and Leylin get some much needed rest after the ordeal of the prior few days. Being surrounded by the strange Dunedain serves to make them feel even closer together.

### Undertaking 2: Meet Patron
On the second day of our stay at the camp, we are invited to meet Gilraen. (Not actually an official patron, but she'll act as a substitute for Bilbo since he's back in Hobbiton)

In their conversation with Gilraen, Leylin and Hamar explained the Spider’s attempt to use ancient dwarven maps to uncover a site of power, leading to his partial corruption. Gilraen recognized the danger, suggesting the maps might point to dwarven outposts near Angmar, a region steeped in ancient evil. As a favor, Gilraen tasked the pair with investigating reports of strange activity around the Trollshaws, potentially tied to the Spider’s schemes or darker forces, and urged them to report back with their findings. Gilraen assigns [[Caladwen]], a young but capable ranger, to accompany the group into the Trollshaws to help us understand if the oddities there are connected to what we've seen in the past.
