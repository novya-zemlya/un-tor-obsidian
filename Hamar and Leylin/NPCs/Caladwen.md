Caladwen is a woman of sharp wit and quiet strength, with dark hair tied back in a simple braid and piercing green eyes that seem to notice every detail. Though youthful compared to her kin, her demeanor is steady, and her movements are deliberate, as though she weighs each step. She wears the practical garb of the Rangers: a muted green cloak, leather bracers, and a well-worn longbow slung over her shoulder. Her presence exudes a calm confidence, tempered by a readiness to act swiftly when needed.
