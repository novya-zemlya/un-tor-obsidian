### Description
![[HobbitMarigold.png|profile+medium right lp]] Marigold Heathertoes is a sprightly hobbit with curly auburn hair that tumbles just past her shoulders, often adorned with a sprig of fresh herbs or flowers. Her freckled face is round and cheerful, with bright green eyes that sparkle with curiosity and mischief. She wears a practical but well-loved traveling cloak and carries a satchel brimming with seeds, herbs, and small trinkets she collects during her journeys. Despite her modest appearance, she has an air of quiet confidence, always ready with a warm smile or a clever quip.

### Distinctive Traits
1. *Resourceful:* Marigold is adept at finding creative solutions, whether itâ€™s using her knowledge of plants for healing or navigating tricky social situations with charm.
2. *Inquisitive:* She has an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond the Shire, often asking questions or poking around places most hobbits would avoid.
