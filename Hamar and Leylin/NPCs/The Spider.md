Always cloaked in shadow, he prefers to let others fight on his behalf, relying on intimidation and subtlety to achieve his goals. His voice is smooth but carries an edge of menace, and he appears to be the leader of a growing network of unsavory characters. His true motives remain unclear, but itâ€™s evident that he values the map and its secrets above all else.
