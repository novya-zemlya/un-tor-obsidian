### Notes and Clues

#### [[2.1 AP - The Trollshaws]]
Need to investigate strange lights in the woods to see if they are related to The Spider's activities.

#### [[1.3 AP - Into the Hills]]
 - Perhaps the box with elven runes was lost by [[Elenion]] since he was also in this area?
 - Next step is to pursue spider to "The Stone Circle" - where is it?
